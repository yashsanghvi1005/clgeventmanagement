<h1>About Us</h1>

<p id="bj"> In 1994, Shri Charotar Moti Sattavis Patidar Kelavani Mandal was established from the parental organization (Matrusanstha) Shri Charotar Moti Sattavis Leuva Patidar Samaj, which has been working in the mission of social service through education for more than 125 years. The founder-president of the Kelavani mandal, the late Shri Chhotabhai Bhikhabhai Patel, and the late Dr. K.C. Patel (a renowned nuclear scientist and a prominent educationist of Gujarat), who succeeded him worked on the idea of a university at Education Campus, Changa (ECC). ECC started with the establishment of Charotar Institute of Technology - Changa (CITC) as the first institute which is now known as Chandubhai S. Patel Institute of Technology (CSPIT) in the year 2000.

With the need for autonomy, the ECC applied for university status at UGC and Gujarat Government, which was granted on July 7, 2009, when the ECC was accorded the status of University and Charotar University of Science and Technology was established.</p>
